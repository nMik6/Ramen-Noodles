        would like to do.
        
        Missing two meetings (with contact) will require that you provide feedback 
        on the meeting notes. 

        Failure to do so will result in a missed meeting as if there was no contact.
        
        Missing the soft deadline
        
        Failure to communicate on time sensitive things within a 48 hour period during 
        the first 2 weeks of the sprint, and a 24 hour period during the last week of the spring.
