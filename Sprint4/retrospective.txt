Thomas Crownover:
Worked: Scheduling. By this sprint, we'd gotten fairly good at starting early and getting things done well before the deadline.
Didn't Work: Lopsided job assignment. Some of us wound up working on things that needed little work, and some of use wound up working on things that took significantly more.
Change: I feel our communication dwindled somewhat near the end, and wish we could have been better at it.
