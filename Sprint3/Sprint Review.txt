List of what worked, what didn't work.

Thomas
  What worked: Assigning multiple people to a job. That way, each task has better coverage to make sure it gets done and any bugs are more likely to be found and corrected.
  Didn't work: Issues with planning. Some of us who were assigned to the same job had different design philosophies that didn't mesh well. But this was a pretty minor issue.
  Change: More specific and more rapid deadline setting. Simply put, we need to get more stuff done sooner.

Stephen
  What worked: early detailed planning gave us a more structured program.
  What  didnâ€™t work: a lot of coding was left for the last week or two of the sprint
  What we should do in the future: Have code completed the week prior and do review/tweaking
Skyler
  What worked: Pulling together as a team to create and polish many of the items responsible. 
  What didn't work: Initial divison of the tasks fell apart quickly, with lots of functionality not being complete until the final week.
  Change: All functionality / non-polish code needs to be complete at least one week before the due date. Code that is not complete must be resplit the following week.

Nathan
  What worked: Meeting early and spending a good period of time discussing the things that were to be done.
  What didn't work: Not discussing how things would fully work, but rather the big picture.
  What should we change?: More break down of what we are trying to accomplish
