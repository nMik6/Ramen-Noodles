Retrospective:

  Thomas:
    What worked: Communication. Most of us have been quick to respond to concerns and comments on our Discord server, allowing for better coordination and thus better work.
    What didn't work: Scheduling. We've all been having trouble keeping up with our own self-imposed work schedules, causing a lot of the work to be skewed much closer to when out projects are due than we had originally planned.
    Start doing: Personal Time Management. I'll admit a lot of my problems with this project have been due to issues I have with managing my time. Hasn't helped that I've been especially busy this last week. This is more of a personal goal to change, as I don't know how well it applies to my fellow group members.
    
  Stephen:
    What worked: Planning session at the start of sprint was very detailed on what we needed to accomplish and helped organize the work better.
    What didn't work: One person to a task (this goes for sprint one as well). having a more in depth review or two people collaborating on any given part of the project would lead to better more thought out code with less revising needed (probably). 
    Start doing: We should set more soft deadlines to try andmanage our sprint better across the weeks (hard to do for 1 week sprint)
