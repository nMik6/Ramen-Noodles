Sprint Review:

Sprint 2:
What is accomplished: 
Added functionality to handle 2nd type of race (parallel individual). 
Expanded Simulator to pass this on to Race, and Race to handle the new type of race.
Added Logger called by the "EXPORT #" command that creates a file with the racer data (numbers/times)

Still to do:

Acceptance Test Outputs:


Retrospective:

  Thomas:
    What worked: Communication. Most of us have been quick to respond to concerns and comments on our Discord server, allowing for better coordination and thus better work.
    What didn't work: Scheduling. We've all been having trouble keeping up with our own self-imposed work schedules, causing a lot of the work to be skewed much closer to when out projects are due than we had originally planned.
    Start doing: Personal Time Management. I'll admit a lot of my problems with this project have been due to issues I have with managing my time. Hasn't helped that I've been especially busy this last week. This is more of a personal goal to change, as I don't know how well it applies to my fellow group members.
    
  Stephen:
    What worked: Planning session at the start of sprint was very detailed on what we needed to accomplish and helped organize the work better.
    What didn't work: One person to a task (this goes for sprint one as well). having a more in depth review or two people collaborating on any given part of the project would lead to better more thought out code with less revising needed (probably). 
    Start doing: We should set more soft deadlines to try andmanage our sprint better across the weeks (hard to do for 1 week sprint)
